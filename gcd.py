# The greatest common divisor of two positive integers, A and B, is the largest number that can be evenly divided into both of them. Euclidâ€™s algorithm can be used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers.

# 1. Compute the remainder of dividing the larger number by the smaller number.
# 2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.
# 3. Repeat this process until the smaller number is zero.
